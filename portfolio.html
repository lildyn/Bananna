        <p style="color:blue;"> One of my favorite hobbies is reading. I love books in the mystery genre. <br> I grew up in a very musical home
        so I love playing the piano and singing as well. I am really bad at cooking and baking but I am trying to get better with practice. <br>
    I can make really good mac and cheese though but only sometimes.</p>
